  - `normalize_all/1` - normalize a list of fractions and integers, like `normalize/2`
  - `sum/2` - sum a list of fractions and integers
  - `lcm/1` - find Least Common Multiple from a list of integers

 - `Chunky.Grid` module for working with two dimensional data
  - `Grid.new/3` - generate a grid from a value or a function
  - `Grid.get_at/2` and `Grid.get_at/3` - access cell value by 2d index
